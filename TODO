# TODO

- Before creating lambda string make syntax tree flat (to array), then some optimizations can be done

- Skip every empty lines, even with different indent (code can be much readable)

- Everything has indent logic

- normal comments should appear in code (for debugging purpose)

- merging all attributes with same name (eg class names)

### To implement

- mixins
    - call `+mixin_name(attribute1, named_attribute1: value1)
    			div
    				| normal block content to mixin OR
                &chapter
                	p content to named block`
    
    - define `mixin mixin_name(attribute1, named_attribute1: default_value)
    			div.default
    				&default_block.call
    			div.chapter_content
    				&chapter.call      // calling block, can be used .nil? for inspecting if was the block defined`

- code result `/==?/`


### To think about

- footnotes
- links
    - to different location in book and same file
    - to website
