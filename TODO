# TODO

- Before creating lambda string make syntax tree flat (to array), then some optimizations can be done

- Skip every empty lines, even with different indent (code can be much readable)

- Everything has indent logic
	- `//` : text after and below with higher indent is in comment
	- same with text (`|`)

- Required indent is one tab (for now)

### To implement

- classes (`tag.class_name`)
- id (`tag#id_text`)

- div implicitly (class `.div_class_name`, id `#div_id_text`)

- tag attribute values as code

- comments: `//`
- html comments: `//!`

- mixins
    - call `+mixin_name(attribute1, named_attribute1: value1)
    			div
    				| normal block content to mixin OR
                &chapter
                	p content to named block`
    
    - define `mixin mixin_name(attribute1, named_attribute1: default_value)
    			div.default
    				&default_block.call
    			div.chapter_content
    				&chapter.call      // calling block, can be used .nil? for inspecting if was the block defined`

### To think

- footnotes
- links
    - to different location in book and same file
    - to website
