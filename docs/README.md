# Bade

Syntax of Bade templates heavily relies on indentation and line indicators:

**Indentation** is key, it controls nesting of result content. Indentation can be done with tabs or spaces. Do not mix them, not sure what will happen.

**Line indicators** defines meaning of rest of the line. They are documented in separate file [line_indicators.md](./line_indicators.md).
