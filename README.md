Minimalistic template engine written in Ruby for Ruby. Developed mainly to help with creating e-books. Highly influenced by [Jade](http://jade-lang.com) and [Slim](http://slim-lang.com).

The language is in development state, breaking changes can be made in future. Current version supports minimal list of features to make it working in production for my purposes.
